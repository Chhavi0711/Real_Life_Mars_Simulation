# Real_Life_Mars_Simulation
This project explores the survival potential of microbial and plant life under simulated Martian conditions through computational modeling and hardware prototyping. We designed a custom 15×15×15 cm test chamber that replicates Martian pressure (~600 Pa), temperature (−60°C to 20°C), UV radiation, and atmospheric composition. A Python-based simulation modeled bacterial growth dynamics, revealing biomass reduction of 30–70% and survival rates dropping to 10–20%. The study also analyzed spore formation rates and stress responses under low gravity and regolith conditions, contributing to astrobiology and life support research.
